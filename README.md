Below is a concise and well-structured README for your GitHub repository for the Liveness Detection System project. It includes essential sections like project overview, features, installation instructions, usage, and more, all tailored to what weâ€™ve built together.

Liveness Detection System
Real-time liveness detection to verify human presence using MediaPipe and OpenCV. Offers two challenges: blink detection (via Eye Aspect Ratio) and gesture recognition (finger counting). Users choose via console, with results shown for 2 seconds before refreshing.

Features
Blink Detection: Tracks eye contours and counts blinks using iris landmarks.
Gesture Recognition: Counts raised fingers with refined thumb logic.
User Choice: Console selection (1: Blink, 2: Gesture, 3: End).
Visual Feedback: Displays eye outlines and detection results.
Camera Management: Closes/reopens webcam between challenges.


Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Webcam


Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/liveness-detection-system.git
                      cd liveness-detection-system

Install dependencies: pip install mediapipe opencv-python

Run the script: python LivenessDetection.py

Follow console prompts:
1: Blink Detection Test (blink the specified number of times).
2: Gesture Recognition Test (raise the specified fingers).
3: End Test.
Press c to submit your challenge response;

How It Works
Blink Detection: Uses MediaPipe Face Mesh to track iris landmarks, calculates EAR to count blinks.
Gesture Recognition: Uses MediaPipe Hands to detect finger positions.
Flow: Camera opens, user selects challenge, result displays for 2s, camera closes, then re-prompts.
